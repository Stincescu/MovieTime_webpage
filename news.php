	<center><img class="news" src="images/stire1.jpg">
	<p>
	In a year when awards shows are trying to adapt to the climate that pandemic living has imposed upon us all, the producers behind this year’s 93rd Academy Awards
	seem to be trying to maintain their usual routine. With attendees not being offered an option to Zoom into the show, or wear hoodies while attending, the Oscars 
	ceremony is trying to keep the traditional glitz it's always possessed. And yet, the hosting plans for this year’s show have been announced, and I’m not here for
	the continued lack of them.
	</p>
	<p>
	That’s right, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences are, yet again, going without a host. Deadline caught wind of these plans through sources close to
	the planning phases of this year’s Oscars telecast. Instead, offers have been put out to presenters that will introduce the various awards, special honors, and 
	segments for the evening, just like they have for the past two years. Which is probably the biggest mistake this year’s show could make, as far as I’m concerned.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yes, hosts can be awkward, especially when you’re holding an awards ceremony during the still raging pandemic that’s ever present. But in a year when Oscar producers
	 Jesse Collins, Stacey Sher and Steven Soderbergh are urging attendees to “read the room” when on the stage at this year's ceremony, it’s kind of surprising that the
	  first part of that big equation isn’t being heeded. If the Oscars are trying to play to a sense of normalcy and pageantry, it’s time to bring back the hosting gig.

	<h2 id = "article_2">China Box Office: ‘Avatar’ Leads With a Further $14 Million</h2>
	<center><img class ="news" src="images/stire2.jpg">
<p>
James Cameron’s “Avatar” once again led the China box office this weekend, with sales of $14 million over the three-day period.
</P>
<p>
The 2009 film has held its own as the top title every day since its March 12 re-release in China. It has grossed a total of $44 million so far, ten days into its re-run.
When it screened in China in 2010, it was a massive hit, raking in $203 million.
</P>
<p>
Thanks to recent China sales, the sci-fi epic has now regained its crown from “Avengers: Endgame” as the highest grossing movie in history. “Avatar” had held that title 
for a decade with $2.7897 billion in global sales. But in April 2019, “Avengers” squeaked past it with a $2.7902 billion cume. The recent re-release now puts “Avatar” 
squarely back in position as the title to beat once again.
</P>
<p>
“We are proud to reach this great milestone, but Jim and I are most thrilled that the film is back in theaters during these unprecedented times, and we want to thank our
Chinese fans for their support,” “Avatar” producer Jon Landau said last week as the film pushed past the Marvel franchise.

<h2 id = "article_3">'Puss in Boots 2' Gets an Official Title, Release Date and a New Director</h2><center>
<img class="news" src="images/stire3.jpg">
<p>
Universal has finally set a release date for the Puss in Boots sequel, which also now has an official title, according to a report by Deadline. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish 
will premiere September 23, 2022, and will bring back the smooth feline in a new adventure, following the commercial success of the 2011 Shrek spin-off.
</P>
<p>
The sequel will bring back Antonio Banderas to voice Puss in Boots as he journeys after the mythical Last Wish, the only thing that can restore the eight lives he already lost.
 It’s a simple premise that could potentially lead to a great film, but all the changes during the movie’s production have led to a long wait for fans who have been eagerly anticipating a sequel.
</P>
<p>
The first Puss in Boots was a commercial success, with an impressive international box office of $554 million, making a sequel almost mandatory for DreamWorks. However, it’s been 
10 years already, and in the meantime, a sequel movie for Puss in Boots was announced and shelved, and rumors of reboots both for Puss in Boots and Shrek began to swirl. The last
 time we heard about Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, still without an official name, a different director was attached to the project.
</P>
<p>
Now, instead of Bob Persichetti (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), Puss In Boots: The Last Wish will be helmed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift. Crawford and Swift did 
an amazing job working together in The Croods: A New Age, which earned them a Golden Globe nomination for Best Picture.
</P>
<p>
Since we have an official name, the next step is for DreamWorks to release a trailer for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. As soon as it happens, we’ll be able to take a look at what came
 out of this long and winding development road and be sure to report back here.
</P>
<p>
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is set to open September 23, 2022.
